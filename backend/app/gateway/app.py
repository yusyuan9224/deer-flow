## DeerFlow API Gateway

API Gateway for DeerFlow - A LangGraph-based AI agent backend with sandbox execution capabilities.

### Features

- **Models Management**: Query and retrieve available AI models
- **MCP Configuration**: Manage Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configurations
- **Memory Management**: Access and manage global memory data for personalized conversations
- **Skills Management**: Query and manage skills and their enabled status
- **Artifacts**: Access thread artifacts and generated files
- **Health Monitoring**: System health check endpoints

### Architecture

LangGraph requests are handled by nginx reverse proxy.
This gateway provides custom endpoints for models, MCP configuration, skills, and artifacts.
